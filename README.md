Project Title: TrafficPredict - Traffic Forecast using Machine Learning

Project Overview:

TrafficPredict is a machine learning-based system that predicts traffic congestion and volume for road networks. The system utilizes historical traffic data, real-time traffic data, and other relevant factors to provide accurate and reliable forecasts.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather historical and real-time traffic data from various sources (e.g., sensors, cameras, GPS)
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and normalize data for modeling
3. Model Development: Train machine learning models using techniques like:
    - Time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)
    - Regression analysis (e.g., linear, non-linear)
    - Classification analysis (e.g., decision trees, random forests)
4. Model Evaluation: Validate model performance using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE)
5. Forecasting: Generate traffic forecasts for future time periods

Key Features:

1. Accurate Forecasts: Provide accurate and reliable traffic forecasts
2. Real-time Updates: Update forecasts in real-time based on changing traffic conditions
3. Visualization: Visualize traffic forecasts and congestion hotspots
4. Alert System: Send alerts to users about traffic congestion and road closures

Machine Learning Techniques:

1. Time Series Analysis: Analyze historical traffic data to identify patterns and trends
2. Regression Analysis: Model relationships between traffic volume and other factors (e.g., weather, events)
3. Classification Analysis: Classify traffic conditions as congested or non-congested
